        Introduction and overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        We have written this data protection declaration (version 16.06.2021-121763197) in order to be able to offer you in accordance with the requirements of
        <a
          class="adsimple-121763197"
          href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&tid=121763197"

          rel="noopener"
          >General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a
        >
        and applicable national laws to explain which personal data (data for short) we as the responsible party - and the processors commissioned by us (e.g. providers) - process and will process in the future and what legal options you have. The terms used are to be understood as gender-neutral.<br />
        <strong class="adsimple-121763197">In a nutshell:</strong> We provide you with comprehensive information about the data that we process about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data protection declarations usually sound very technical and use legal technical terms. However, this data protection declaration is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. As far as transparency is beneficial, technical terms are 
        <strong class="adsimple-121763197"
          >explained in a reader-friendly manner</strong
        >and <strong class="adsimple-121763197">links</strong> 
        for further information are used.
        We are thus informing in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the context of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible if you make as brief, unclear and legal-technical statements as possible, as they are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative and maybe there is one or the other piece of information that you did not know yet. <br /> If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the one mentioned below or in the imprint to contact the responsible body, to follow the existing links and to view further information on third-party sites. You can of course also find our contact details in the imprint.
      </p>
      <h2 id="anwendungsbereich" class="adsimple-121763197 title-imprint">Scope of application</h2>
      <p>
        This data protection declaration applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). By personal data, we mean information within the meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address and postal address of a person. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, be it online or offline. The scope of this data protection declaration includes:
      </p>
      <ul class="adsimple-121763197">
        <li class="adsimple-121763197">
          all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-121763197">
          Social media appearances and email communication
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-121763197">
          mobile apps for smartphones and other devices
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong class="adsimple-121763197">In a nutshell:</strong> The data protection declaration applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner in the company via the channels mentioned. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.
      </p>
      <h2 id="rechtsgrundlagen" class="adsimple-121763197 title-imprint">Legal bases</h2>
      <p>
        In the following data protection declaration we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data. <br /> As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to the REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course read this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex, the access to EU law at
        <a
          class="adsimple-121763197"
          href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&tid=121763197"

          >https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="adsimple-121763197">
          <strong class="adsimple-121763197">Consent </strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of the data you entered in a contact form.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-121763197">
          <strong class="adsimple-121763197">Contract </strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit.b GDPR): We process your data in order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you. For example, if we conclude a sales contract with you, we need personal information in advance.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-121763197">
          <strong class="adsimple-121763197">Legal obligation </strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we will process your data. For example, we are legally required to keep invoices for bookkeeping. These usually contain personal data.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-121763197">
          <strong class="adsimple-121763197">Legitimate interests </strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit.f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your basic rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we have to process certain data in order to be able to operate our website securely and economically efficiently. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Other conditions such as the taking of recordings in the public interest and the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not usually apply to us. If such a legal basis should be relevant, it will be shown at the appropriate point.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
      <ul class="adsimple-121763197">
        <li class="adsimple-121763197">
          In <strong class="adsimple-121763197">Austria </strong> is the federal law for the protection of natural persons when processing personal data (<strong class = "adsimple-121763197"> Data Protection Act </strong>), in short <strong class = "adsimple-121763197"> DSG </strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="adsimple-121763197">
          In <strong class = "adsimple-121763197"> Germany </strong> the <strong class = "adsimple-121763197"> Federal Data Protection Act </strong>, in short <strong class = "adsimple-121763197"> BDSG </strong> .
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.
      </p>
      <h2 id="speicherdauer" class="adsimple-121763197 title-imprint">Storage period</h2>
      <p>
        The fact that we only store personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products is a general criterion for us. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after the original purpose no longer exists, for example for accounting purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want your data to be deleted or if you revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible and unless there is an obligation to store it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided we have further information.
      </p>

          According to Article 19 GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that we will provide you with your data in a common format on request.

          According to Article 21 GDPR, you have a right of objection, which will result in a change in processing after enforcement.

            <li class="adsimple-121763197">
